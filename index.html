        <p>Hi, my name is Lamoya Small. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering while also exploring my creativity through writing and book design. Under the pen names Oya Charls and Oya Small, I create and sell coloring books and journals on Amazon. Alongside my studies, I work as an online ESL teacher, connecting with people from different cultures and helping them learn. I enjoy expressing myself through art and poetry, and I take pride in staying organized and committed to my goals. Outside of work and school, I dedicate time to creative projects that bring me joy and fuel my personal growth. I am particularly interested in Web Development, as it allows me to combine technical skills with creativity to build interactive and visually engaging websites. </p>
